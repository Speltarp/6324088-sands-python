# Signals and Systems practical
## Introduction
This repository was made for the python part of the course Signals and Systems and 
contains scripts to create, modify and plot signals in python.
This will be done using multiple files and modules, where we use different 
modules with functions which will be used in different python scripts.

## How to use
There are two main files, signals, which contains the functions and run, where 
we use and run these functions. From the signals file we import various functions
such as ```generate_sine_wave(frequency, duration, sample_rate) ``` and ```u(start, finish, amplitude, sample_rate)```
